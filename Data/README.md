# Data Folder
This folder contains the data used for exploring Self-Adaptive Systems research and visualizing results.

Within this folder are four files:

`RTC_collectedpapers.csv` - This .csv file contains all available papers that could potentially be selected for the systematic literature review.
`RTC_papersfinal_csv.csv` - This .csv file contains the 100 selected papers which matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review, including all the visualizations found within each paper that displayed a self-adaptive artifact.
`Data_exploration.ipynb` - This .ipynb notebook file contains the data exploration performed on RTC_papersfinal_csv.csv to explore any common trends across all papers and their respective categories.
`Dummy_visualizations.ipynb` - This .ipynb notebook file contains dummy visualizations used in my Master's thesis to showcase which type of visualizations were found within the 100 selected papers.
