IN PROGRESS

This repository contains the data for a Master's thesis on experiment visualizations used in self-adaptive systems research between 2012 and 2021. The results and visualization of these results can be found in the Data folder.

Alongside this overview of visualizations is a program for visualizing results in realtime known as Real-time Charts (RTC). RTC can connect to various external data sources and provides a flexible platform for programming new data connections and graph types to visualize results. The application is written in Python using the Plotly Dash and Plotly Express modules for generating a web app. The files to this app can be found in the RTC_main folder.
